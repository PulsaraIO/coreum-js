# Interface: Duration

[<internal>](../modules/internal_.md).Duration

A Duration represents a signed, fixed-length span of time represented
as a count of seconds and fractions of seconds at nanosecond
resolution. It is independent of any calendar and concepts like "day"
or "month". It is related to Timestamp in that the difference between
two Timestamp values is a Duration and it can be added or subtracted
from a Timestamp. Range is approximately +-10,000 years.

# Examples

Example 1: Compute Duration from two Timestamps in pseudo code.

    Timestamp start = ...;
    Timestamp end = ...;
    Duration duration = ...;

    duration.seconds = end.seconds - start.seconds;
    duration.nanos = end.nanos - start.nanos;

    if (duration.seconds < 0 && duration.nanos > 0) {
      duration.seconds += 1;
      duration.nanos -= 1000000000;
    } else if (duration.seconds > 0 && duration.nanos < 0) {
      duration.seconds -= 1;
      duration.nanos += 1000000000;
    }

Example 2: Compute Timestamp from Timestamp + Duration in pseudo code.

    Timestamp start = ...;
    Duration duration = ...;
    Timestamp end = ...;

    end.seconds = start.seconds + duration.seconds;
    end.nanos = start.nanos + duration.nanos;

    if (end.nanos < 0) {
      end.seconds -= 1;
      end.nanos += 1000000000;
    } else if (end.nanos >= 1000000000) {
      end.seconds += 1;
      end.nanos -= 1000000000;
    }

Example 3: Compute Duration from datetime.timedelta in Python.

    td = datetime.timedelta(days=3, minutes=10)
    duration = Duration()
    duration.FromTimedelta(td)

# JSON Mapping

In JSON format, the Duration type is encoded as a string rather than an
object, where the string ends in the suffix "s" (indicating seconds) and
is preceded by the number of seconds, with nanoseconds expressed as
fractional seconds. For example, 3 seconds with 0 nanoseconds should be
encoded in JSON format as "3s", while 3 seconds and 1 nanosecond should
be expressed in JSON format as "3.000000001s", and 3 seconds and 1
microsecond should be expressed in JSON format as "3.000001s".

## Properties

### nanos

• **nanos**: `number`

Signed fractions of a second at nanosecond resolution of the span
of time. Durations less than one second are represented with a 0
`seconds` field and a positive or negative `nanos` field. For durations
of one second or more, a non-zero value for the `nanos` field must be
of the same sign as the `seconds` field. Must be from -999,999,999
to +999,999,999 inclusive.

___

### seconds

• **seconds**: `number`

Signed seconds of the span of time. Must be from -315,576,000,000
to +315,576,000,000 inclusive. Note: these bounds are computed from:
60 sec/min * 60 min/hr * 24 hr/day * 365.25 days/year * 10000 years
